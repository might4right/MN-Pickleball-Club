<h2>Well, hello there.</h2>

<p>I'm in between my junior and senior years, studying <b>Technical Writing + Communication</b> with the Biology and Medicine subplan. My two minors are in <b>Pharmacology</b> and <b>Linguistics.</b></p>

<h2>Professional</h2>

<p>My ideal career lies at the intersection of health policy, administrative law, and regulatory affairs, both in drug development and delivery of care. There are a wide variety of roads leading to such a career, but so far I'm leaning toward public health school, law school, or some combination of the two. If it's pertinent to gastroenterology, all the better as that's a specialty personal to me.</p>

<p>Tech comm is a vast field, however, and my love for learning about anything and everything overpowers all. Last summer I interned with Advanced Training Systems, which produces specialized robotic equipment for the defense, law enforcement, and energy security sectors. In this role, I both updated documentation for and assembled a wide variety of products, giving me a unique background in mechanical engineering and machining which can transfer to other industries.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>When I'm not studying, you'll likely find me out in motion in some manner. These days, it's usually cycling, pickleball, or ballroom dancing. I have also taught karate for many years at a local dojo and am currently working on a third-degree black belt.</p>
